The process started with generating 501 images, then filtering out 20 unrealistic ones, leaving 489 images which were manually annotated with bounding boxes for 8,590 apples.

By converting simple textual prompts (e.g., “occluded apples in orchards”) into photorealistic images, LLMs enable the creation of scalable, annotated datasets that faithfully replicate real-world complexities without the need for physical data collection Sapkota et al.

For this research, a synthetic dataset of 489 manually annotated images (1024x1024 pixels each) was created to train the YOLOv12 object detection model.  The methodology involved four steps:  1) image generation using a Large Language Model and dataset preparation; 2) training the YOLOv12 object detection model on synthetic images to detect apples; 3) evaluating performance metrics and comparing them to YOLOv11 and YOLOv10; and 4) testing with real-world images collected by a machine vision sensor.",
